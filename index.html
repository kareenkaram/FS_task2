<p> Hello! My name is Kareen Karam, and I am a graduate of Birzeit University, where I earned my degree in Computer Engineering in 2022. 
    I've gained valuable experience working in the field of Quality Assurance (QA) for over a year, where I honed my skills in testing
    software applications to identify bugs and track them. </p>

<p> I am currently enrolled in this course to broaden my technical expertise
    and dive deeper into web development. I am eager to enhance my skill set and stay at the forefront of technology.  </p>
